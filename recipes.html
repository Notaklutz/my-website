        Food is one of life's simple pleasures. There is nothing more satisfying than cooking up a delicious meal for yourself, your family, or your friends and then being able to say
        that you—yes, you—made that yourself. It's the same kind of joy that civil engineers get when they design a bridge that they can drive on themselves. Something they can point
        to and say that a part of them is in that creation. Cooking is just as enjoyable and so much more accessible. I don't consider myself a great cook—but I do consider myself a
        great learner. Here is where you will find recipes that I have created and adapted while learning how to cook. Many of these recipes are easy, cheap, and accessible—perfect
        for people on a budget, beginner cooks, or lazy chefs. I hope you will enjoy some of the recipes I have created and I thank you for joining me on my culinary odyssey. If you happen
        to make any of my recipes, please feel free to contact me with photos, suggestions, or comments and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
